Welcome to my github page, my name is Daniel (if you couldn't guess), <br>
|   and i am currently working on creating a new workflow system from the bottom up. <br>
Starting off with my own multi-device assembly language called zsm (or zembly) and, <br>
|   eventually moving on to Z, Z++, Z#, and Z*. <br>
These languages will then be used to create my own operating system (no name yet), <br>
|   where i will try to create an operating system designed for compatibility,  <br>
|   (e.g. Linux, Windows, OSX and maybe even some phone operating systems). <br>
I will also create a standard library to work with these languages <br>
