Welcome to my github page, my name is Daniel (if you couldn't guess),
 and i am currently working on creating a new workflow system from the bottom up.
Starting off with my own multi-device assembly language called zsm (or zembly) and,
 eventually moving on to Z, Z++, Z#, and Z*.
These languages will then be used to create my own operating system (no name yet),
 where i will try to create an operating system designed for compatibility, 
 (e.g. Linux, Windows, OSX and maybe even some phone operating systems).
I will also create a standard library to work with these languages
