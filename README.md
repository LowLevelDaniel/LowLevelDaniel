Welcome to my github page, my name is Daniel (if you couldn't guess), <br>
<br>
I am currently working on creating a new workflow system from the bottom up. <br>
<br>
I have childish visions of my own programmings languages, debuggers, standard libraries and operating system. <br>
This will take ground slowly, starting with networking, graphics and computer startup. <br>
